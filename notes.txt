CREATING YOUR OWN REPO:

1. git init (inside of exactly where you want the git created)
2. Go into GitHub and create the repo in the browser 
3. git remote add origin (url) ...the URL is what you just created in the browser.
4. git add . for all files or git add (fileName) to add just one file at a time.
5. git commit -m "message" created a message that actually shows up on GitHub and can be seen by potentail employers on the repo 
6. git push origin (nameOfBranch) and for now the name of the branch is almost always main or master
